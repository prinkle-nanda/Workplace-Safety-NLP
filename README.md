# Project Overview
This Final project is completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning and it focuses on analyzing workplace accident reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning models. It aims to classify incidents, predict severity, and enhance industrial safety through an AI-powered chatbot

# Key Objectives
  * Develop an NLP-based chatbot for workplace safety professionals.
  * Analyze accident descriptions and identify risk factors & critical hazards.
  * Train Machine Learning & Deep Learning models to classify accident severity.
  * Implement Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, Sentence Transformers).
  * Build and optimize Neural Networks, LSTMs, and Transformer-based models (BERT).
  * Compare model performances and deploy the best classifier for real-world usage.

# Tools & Libraries Used
  * Python (Jupyter Notebook)
  * TensorFlow, Keras (Deep Learning Models)
  * Hugging Face Transformers (BERT for NLP)
  * Scikit-Learn, XGBoost (Machine Learning Models)
  * Gensim (Word2Vec & GloVe Embeddings)
  * NLTK (Text Preprocessing)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  * Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

# Analysis Performed
  * Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
     - Removing missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns
     - Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization
     - Word embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, Sentence Transformer
     - Handling class imbalance using SMOTE + Random Undersampling
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Identifying accident patterns across industries & locations
     - Visualizing accident severity and risk distribution
  * Model Training & Evaluation
     - Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes
     - Deep Learning Models: Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers (BERT)
     - Evaluating models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
  * Chatbot Development
     - Pickling the best model
     - Pickl file can be used later for chatbot development
  * Business Insights & Recommendations
     - Identifying high-risk industries and proposing safety measures
     - Enhancing training programs based on accident patterns
